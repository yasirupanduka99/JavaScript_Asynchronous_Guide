    <h3>What is Asynchronous JavaScript?</h3>

    <p>
        Asynchronous JavaScript is a programming approach that allows JavaScript
        to perform tasks independently of the main execution thread, enabling the
        program to handle other tasks while waiting for long-running operations to
        complete. This is essential for creating efficient and responsive web
        applications, as it prevents the user interface from freezing or becoming
        unresponsive while waiting for operations like network requests, file I/O,
        or timers. <br />

        Here are some key concepts and methods associated with asynchronous
        JavaScript:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Callbacks:</h4>
            <p>
                Definition: A function passed into another function as an argument,
                which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind
                of routine or action.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                function fetchData(callback) {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    callback('Data received');
                }, 1000);
                }

                fetchData((message) => {
                console.log(message); // "Data received" after 1 second
                });          
            </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Promises:</h4>
            <p>
                Definition: An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and
                its resulting value.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  setTimeout(() => {
                    resolve('Data received');
                  }, 1000);
                });
                  
                fetchData.then((message) => {
                  console.log(message); // "Data received" after 1 second
                });          
            </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>async/await:</h4>
            <p>
                Definition: Syntactic sugar built on top of promises, providing a more readable and concise way to
                handle asynchronous code.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                function fetchData() {
                  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                    setTimeout(() => {
                      resolve('Data received');
                    }, 1000);
                  });
                }
                  
                async function getData() {
                  const message = await fetchData();
                  console.log(message); // "Data received" after 1 second
                }
                  
                getData();
                           
            </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Event Loop:</h4>
            <p>
                Definition: The mechanism that handles the execution of multiple chunks of your program, including
                handling asynchronous callbacks. It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading
                tasks to the web API, which then pushes callbacks to the event queue once completed.
            </p>
            <p>Example Workflow:</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                1. JavaScript call stack processes code.
                2. Asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, AJAX calls) are offloaded to the browser's web API.
                3. Once completed, the callback functions are pushed to the event queue.
                4. The event loop checks the event queue and moves the callbacks to the call stack for execution when the stack is empty.          
            </code>
            </pre>
        </li> 
    </ul>


    <h3>Benefits of Asynchronous JavaScript:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Improved Performance: Enables handling multiple operations concurrently without blocking the main thread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhanced User Experience: Keeps the application responsive by allowing other interactions while waiting for slow tasks to complete.
        </li>
        <li>
            Better Resource Utilization: Efficiently uses system resources by not keeping the CPU idle while waiting for I/O operations.
        </li>
    </ul>
