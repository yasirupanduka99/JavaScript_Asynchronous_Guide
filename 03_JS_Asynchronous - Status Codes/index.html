    <h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>

    <h3>HTML Error Messages</h3>
    <p>
      When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur,
      and the server might return an error code like "404 Not Found". <br />

      It is common to name these errors HTML error messages.<br />

      But these messages are something called HTTP status messages. In fact, the
      server always returns a message for every request. The most common message
      is 200 OK.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Below is a list of HTTP status messages that might be returned:</p>
    <br />
