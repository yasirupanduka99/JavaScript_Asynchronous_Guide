    <h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
    <p>
      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable
      communications between clients and servers. <br />

      HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.<br />

      Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the
      server returns a response to the client. The response contains status
      information about the request and may also contain the requested content.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>HTTP Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>GET</li>
      <li>POST</li>
      <li>PUT</li>
      <li>HEAD</li>
      <li>DELETE</li>
      <li>PATCH</li>
      <li>OPTIONS</li>
      <li>CONNECT</li>
      <li>TRACE</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.</p>
    <br />

    <h3>The GET Method</h3>
    <p>GET is used to request data from a specified resource.</p>
    <p><b>Some notes on GET requests:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>GET requests can be cached</li>
      <li>GET requests remain in the browser history</li>
      <li>GET requests can be bookmarked</li>
      <li>
        GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
      </li>
      <li>GET requests have length restrictions</li>
      <li>GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>The POST Method</h3>
    <p>POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.</p>
    <p><b>Some notes on POST requests:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>POST requests are never cached</li>
      <li>POST requests do not remain in the browser history</li>
      <li>POST requests cannot be bookmarked</li>
      <li>POST requests have no restrictions on data length</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>The PUT Method</h3>
    <p>
      PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. <br />
      The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent.
      That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce
      the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side
      effects of creating the same resource multiple times.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>The HEAD Method</h3>
    <p>
      HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body. <br />
      In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users
      will make the same request but will not return the list of users. <br />
      A HEAD request is useful for checking what a GET request will return
      before actually making a GET request - a HEAD request can read the
      Content-Length header to check the size of the file, without actually
      downloading the file.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>The DELETE Method</h3>
    <p>The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.</p>
    <br />

    <h3>The PATCH Method</h3>
    <p>
      The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>The OPTIONS Method</h3>
    <p>
      The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target
      resource.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>The CONNECT Method</h3>
    <p>
      The CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel)
      with the requested resource.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>The TRACE Method</h3>
    <p>
      The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that tests
      the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes).
